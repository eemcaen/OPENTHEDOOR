		<h1>Rachel Carson</h1>
		<div class="left" style="font-size:30pt">
			Rachel Carson has <span>sparked a global nature conservation movement as well as the U.S. against the use of pesticides, including DDT (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane).</span> Marine biologist Rachel Carson has launched a strong campaign against DDT, finding it causes serious ecological damage and cancer, and has eventually led to the U.S. government's ban on DDT.</span>
			<br><br>
			Rachel Carson was born in 1907 in Pennsylvania. Rachel's childhood dream was to become a novelist. He was <span>so talented at writing</span> that a novel he wrote when he was only 10 years old was published in a children's magazine. Rachel, who also majored in English literature in college, became <span>interested in biology and eventually changed her major to zoology.</span>
			<br><br>
			Rachel studied oceans and their ecosystems at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts every summer. With the study and experience there, I started working at the Federal Water Resources Institute in Washington D.C. in the mid-1930s.
			<br><br>
			During her career, Rachel wrote about various life forms in the ocean in the monthly journal Atlantic Monthly. He also published her first book, "Under the Sea Wind," in 1941.
			<br><br>
			Rachel's book "Silent Spring", considered the most influential book of the 20th century, came out in 1962, after the creation of this time capsule. Rachel was aware of DDT's problems and spent four years collecting and studying DDT-induced damage cases from around the world. And in her book "Silence Spring", based on this, Rachel explicitly exposed the ecosystem being destroyed by indiscriminate use of pesticides.
			<br><br>
			The first year since "Silent Spring" was published, it has become so popular that it has sold 600,000 copies that people find shocking facts about the harmful effects of synthetic pesticides. In addition, more than 40 U.S. states were introduced to limit pesticides, and in 1963, the Kennedy administration formed an environmental advisory panel and states began banning the use of DDT. In 1969, the U.S. Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act, which would eventually ban the use of DDT by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1972.
