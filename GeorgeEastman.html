		<h1>George Eastman</h1>
		<div class="left" style="font-size:30pt">
			George Eastman, who brought <span>innovation to photography culture through the development of Kodak films and cameras</span>, was born in Waterville, New York, in 1854. Eastman, who grew up in a difficult environment, including poverty and the early death of his father, attended public school until he was 13, and that was all about formal education. Since then, he made a living by <span>working as an insurance salesman and a banker</span>, etc.
			<br><br>
			One day a bank colleague working with him suggested that he go on a trip to take a picture. It was an interesting suggestion, but Eastman gave up his trip because of heavy equipment. Eastman, who was usually interested in science, began to think about whether he could not take pictures more easily instead. 
			<br><br>
			For Eastman, the kitchen was a laboratory. Photography at that time was a way of recording images on glass plates. One day, Eastman, who spent about three years <span>studying how to reduce glass plates</span>, was able to create a much more sensitive emulsion than conventional chemicals. And finally instead of glass plates, He made a light film with chemicals on the paper. That's how roll film, which can be rolled up, was born.
			<br><br> 
			It was a breakthrough, but only a small film did not mean that we could take a picture. Eastman launched a small film-equipped camera in 1888. The Kodak camera, which is easy to take without having to carry a lot of luggage, was a revolutionary product.
			<br><br>
			Eastman formally <span>founded a company called Eastman Kodak</span>. Kodak developed and printed the film and sent it to customers. Eastman went on to develop the first transparent roll film made of celluloid, followed by pocket cameras, or small cameras that can carry around in their pockets. The popularization of cameras soon spread around the world. Eastman also introduced a $1 camera that was his dream, a brownie that could also be taken by children in 1900 with a mass production system that sold 250,000 units in a year with its easy use and stylish design.
			<br><br>
			Kodak, which has been innovated repeatedly, won various patents such as ink, toner, printer, and printing paper and has dominated the market by buying or combining its competitors. Kodak had been the world's largest company in photography for nearly a century. Kodak accounted for 90 percent of the U.S. film market in its heyday and was also the largest film producer. More than 30,000 employees were employed in film production at Kodak headquarters in Rochester, and Eastman became the sign that ranked sixth on the U.S. property man list at the time.
			<br><br>
			In charity work, Eastman was also one of the nation's largest donors. Most people didn't know much about his donations because he did charity work quietly. But he established engineering colleges, supported many black universities and contributed greatly to the education and medical fields, including the construction of many clinics.
