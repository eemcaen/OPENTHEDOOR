		<h1>William Randolph Hearst</h1>
		<div class="left" style="font-size:30pt">
			William Randolph Hearst was born in San Francisco. He was the only son of a family who became rich in the mines. Hearst had a childhood nothing to envy. Hirst started getting interested in newspapers when he went to Harvard University. Father George Hirst wanted his son to run the mine. George Hirst, who ran the San Francisco Examiner newspaper in San Francisco, was elected a federal senator in 1887. At that time, his son William Hurst, who was only 23 years old, was <span>assigned to run the newspaper.</span> 
			<br><br>
			William Hirst had no experience in business, but he was motivated to make a newspaper that was on the lips of people. He spent a lot of time and effort on newspapers, giving them the best salary and attracting great journalists. He also tried to improve relationship with newspaper advertisers. 
			<br><br>
			As a result, the article of San Francisco Iggyminer became more powerful and interesting than before. But the story was easy and easy to read. By 1891, the newspaper's subscribers and advertisers had tripled from the time Hurst was taken over by his father. 
			<br><br>
			Hurst bought a second newspaper called <span>The New York Journal.</span> Hurst was in fierce competition with Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World newspaper at the time. Hirst doubled the salaries of journalists, hiring several talented Pulitzer reporters and lowering newspaper subscription fees. Hirst has increased sales from 30,000 to 100,000.
			<br><br>
			Hurst continued to emerge as a newspaper tycoon by launching or buying new newspapers and magazines. He jumped into politics as well as his influence grew. Hurst was elected to the Federal House of Representatives from New York in 1903 and served a second term until 1907. In 1904, he ran unsuccessfully for president of the Democratic Party, governor of New York, mayor of New York, etc.
			<br><br>
			In the meantime, Hirst's business grew bigger and bigger, and he continued to buy newspapers and magazines abroad as well as in the United States. They also bought radio and television networks, motion picture companies. Hurst and his wife Milicent married in 1903 and <span>had five children.</span>Hurst spent $30 million to <span>build the super-luxury mansion in San Simeon.</span> He also invested a lot of money in buying artwork and displayed such items inside the house. Hurst and Maryon often invited celebrities to the house for parties.
			<br><br>
			Hurst was in danger of publishing in the 1930s due to excessive consumption. So he had to sell a lot of real estate and art. The recovery of the economy after World War II has helped save media companies. And Hurst donated his mansion in San Simeon to the state government. As a result, many historical artworks became public property.
