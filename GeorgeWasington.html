		<h1>George Wasington Carver</h1>
		<div class="left" style="font-size:30pt">
			George Washington Carver is <span>an agrochemical, botanist and agricultural economist</span> who has <span>developed numerous agricultural products that have greatly changed the landscape of the U.S. agricultural economy</span>.
			<br><br>
			George was weak to work on the farm, but he was very inquisitive. At that time, it is difficult for black to go to school. But he graduated from Minneapolis High School and studied <span>art and piano at Simpson College</span>.
			<br><br>
			He then entered the botanical department of Iowa State College of Agriculture, becoming the school's first black student and first science scholar. George began his research career at an Iowa experimental farm after graduating from college. He was particularly noted for his research on fungal diseases in soybeans and began to be known in the agricultural world for his outstanding research achievements in plant pathology and plant fungology. At the recommendation of his professor in charge, he went to graduate school and received a bachelor's degree in agriculture in 1896.
			<br><br>
			He then devoted himself to education and research at the Tuskee Institute, a black university. Carver created a horse-drawn mobile lab and traveled around the country to help farmers. In fact, one of the big benefits for farmers was <span>how to grow the crop rotation system</span>. At that time, many southern states in the U.S. were seriously reducing their harvests as cotton was being grown on the same land repeatedly, depleting the soil's nutrients.
			Carver devised a way to grow other crops in rotation. First, they grow peanuts that make nitrogen, then sweet potatoes, and then cotton. As a result, cotton harvests have increased enormously, giving enormous help to farmers.
			<br><br>
			Carver also developed more than <span>300 products, ranging from peanuts to food, industrial and industrial products</span>, which are nicknamed <span>&ldquo;Peanut Man&rdquo;</span>. These include milk, Worcester sauce, punch, cooking oil, salad oil, paper, cosmetics, soap and paint that is poured into trees. In addition, the company has developed a peanut-based medicine, such as preservatives, laxative products, and thyroid gland treatments. Carver also invented powder products, vinegar, dyes and ink in sweet potatoes. They also taught poor farmers the idea of feeding acorns instead of buying expensive feed. It has also developed a way to turn a corn stand into a building material.
			<br><br>
			Carver was also a social activist. In the last 20 years of his life, he was not very active in research, but he was active in helping people. He have put a lot of effort into racial harmony. Carver also visited India and met Mahatma Gandhi to discuss nutritional issues in developing countries. Believing that faith could heal social divisions, he taught the Bible at a Sunday school at the University of Tuskgee.
