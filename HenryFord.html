		<h1>Henry Ford</h1>
		<div class="left" style="font-size:30pt">
			Henry Ford was born on July 31, 1863 in a rural town in Michigan, central U.S. Ford was <span>not only interested in machines, but also had a talent for repairing and making.</span> They have also tried and experimented with various machines, including farming machines. When he was less than 10 years old, he was <span>known as Dr. Clock</span> because he fixed all the watches in the neighborhood. It was also extraordinary in creating an organization to work systematically.</span>
			<br><br>
			In 1891, Ford visited Detroit and came across a machine called SILENT OTTO. The gasoline-powered power turned a large wheel but did not move. Henry Ford thought he can move the machine by putting it on the wheel. Ford studied how to do this with his wife Clara after returning home. Ford came up with the idea of having to have electricity to turn the trigger.
			<br><br>
			ut until then, Ford didn't know much about electricity. So <span>He went to an electric company in Detroit and learned how to work. It was Thomas Edison's company called the inventor.</span> While working at the power plant, Ford developed a small starter with a couple of colleagues and finally came out of the first car made by Henry Ford in 1896. The name means 'QUADRICYCLE,' or a four-legged bicycle.
			<br><br>
			In 1899, Ford quit the electric company and started a car company. In 1903, seven years after the Quadri Creek came out, <span>Ford began making cars that ordinary people could ride, not a privileged class.</span> Ford's constant insistence was to make a car that anyone could have. On July 15 of the same year, a public car finally made its debut.. The next year, in 1904, Ford made and sold nearly 600 cars and made a fortune of over $100,000. Ford built a new large factory with the income.
			<br><br>
			It was MODEL T, the mass-produced car from a factory in Detroit. In those days of driving in carriages, MODEL T became the fastest and most reliable means of transportation, and they dominated the love of Americans. MODEL T which went on sale in earnest, were not very cheap, but was affordable to those with some financial capacity. Ford increased production significantly. MODEL T accounted for 50 percent of the U.S. auto market in 1914. In 1923, the rate rose to 57 percent.
			<br><br>
			Ford Motor Co. has expanded its global sales network, with taxis in Hong Kong, most of the cars rolling in South America being Ford's. Ford accounted for half of all the cars in the world. There has never been an auto company that accounted for more than half of the world's production before and ever since. Ford was then considered the richest man in the United States. Ford then went on to publish newspapers and buy rail companies. They built airplanes and hospitals.
			<br><br>
			But there's also a crisis at Ford. Since 1930, Ford later lost ground to General Motors, which launched new models each year and allowed it to pay for them several times, and in 1931, Ford's car sales fell by half the previous year. Ford has since faced a number of problems, including a labor union movement and difficulties in managerial succession.
			<br><br>
			But Henry Ford lived a life of more immersion in cars than anyone else, a person who changed the lives of billions of people in the global community, and a person who developed the automobile industry into the world's largest industry.
